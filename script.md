 **EXT. LAKESIDE PARK - DAY**

The sun hovers in the sky, casting a warm glow over the tranquil surface of the lake. A gentle breeze flutters through the air, creating subtle ripples across the water. In the midst of this serene landscape, a solitary figure sits at a picnic table. 

**JAMIE**, a person in their late twenties, is hunched over a steaming paper cup of coffee. They appear lost in thought, eyes fixed on the ever-changing patterns on the lake's surface. The quiet rustle of leaves and distant chirping of birds form a natural symphony around them.

Suddenly, the soft, rhythmic clatter of **GROCERY BAGS** breaks the spell of silence. 

**RILEY**, around the same age, stands a few feet away, carrying the familiarity of old memories.

**RILEY**  
"…Hey."

**JAMIE**, slightly startled, looks up. Recognition dawns slowly, as if awakening a forgotten chapter.

**JAMIE**  
"…Riley?"

**RILEY**  
"Yeah. It's been a while."

**JAMIE**  
"A while? That's… generous. Try five years."

The weight of time hangs in the air, a tangible presence between them.

**RILEY**  
"Feels shorter."

**JAMIE**  
"Feels longer."

Riley lingers, shifting the grocery bags from one hand to another. An indecision marked by a hundred unspoken words.

**RILEY**  
"I just moved back."

**JAMIE**  
"Why?"

**RILEY**  
"Job ended. Relationship ended. Everything just… ended. So here I am."

Jamie nods, a small acknowledgment of life's unpredictability.

**JAMIE** (quietly)  
"You always said you'd never come back."

**RILEY**  
"I know."

**JAMIE**  
"So what changed?"

**RILEY**  
"…I think I realized I left some things here I didn't want to leave."

The lake captures their reflection, two silhouettes framed by the sprawling landscape. The past shadows their presence, an omnipresent companion.

**JAMIE**  
"Well. The bookstore's still there."

**RILEY**  
"I wasn't talking about the bookstore."

Silence descends once more, a deep, lingering quiet that neither rushes to fill.

**JAMIE**  
"…You should probably get those groceries home before the ice cream melts."

Riley nods, accepting the gentle dismissal with a soft sigh.

**RILEY**  
"Yeah. Maybe I'll see you around?"

The possibility is left hanging in the air, fragile and uncertain.

**JAMIE**  
"Maybe."

With a delicate turn, Riley lifts the bags and begins to walk away, the rustling fading into the distance. Jamie remains seated, eyes returning to the lake, as though seeking answers in its restless depths.

The scene holds, a canvas of quiet revelation as the day wears on—a moment captured, yet bound to the flow of time.
